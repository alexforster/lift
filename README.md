Low-Impact Fingerprint Tool

This is a tool that uses unique characteristics of devices to fingerprint them in the smallest number of requests possible. 

The best way to use this tool is to 

python lift.py -f <file_with_ip_one_per_line> -I 
Other options include

-s <subnet>
-i <single IP>
-a <asn> #warning this doesn't always work right.

****WARNING****
DO NOT USE -v UNLESS YOU WANT ALL THE REASONS WHY SOMETHING IS FAILING.

If you want more signatures added, please add it in to issues. This tool is still in development and will be for some time. Keep your eyes open for changes!
